# FizzBuzz
Fizzbuzz is the time honored example [program](http://imranontech.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/) that serves as a new developer's entry into the coding community.

In Fizzbuzz, you goal is to write a program that returns
* "Fizz" for numbers divided by 3,
* "Buzz" for numbers divided by 5,
* "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both.  
* the original number if the number is indivisible by either 3 or 5

Fizzbuzz can be accomplished just by using what you know about functions and conditional statements. Good developers chunk their program into small parts - they write and test a small part at a time. In this case, start by testing one condition and continue to add to your code until each condition is handled appropriately.
